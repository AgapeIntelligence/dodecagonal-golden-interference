# dodecagonal-golden-interference
Minimal Python gen of a 12-fold symmetric harmonic field using 432-unit carrier and golden-ratio phase offsets across 12 waves. Thresholded superposition yields clean quasiperiodic interference pattern with sharp dodecagonal Bragg peaks scaled by powers of φ — a true 2D 12-fold quasicrystal diffraction analogue.
